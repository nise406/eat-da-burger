Description: Creating a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). Following the MVC design pattern and using Node + MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML. Designed to be used as a communication tool for fellow developers in the community and potential employers.

Usage
Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the middle of the page -- waiting to be devoured.
Each burger in the waiting area. When the user clicks on the hamburger button they just submitted, the burger will move to the botton of the page.
Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
